# Offer finder - idea

My main motivation to create this script was to use python as a form of assistance when I was looking for a new phone - instead of searching through offers manually day by day to find one meeting my criteria in terms of price and memory, I delegated that tedious task to python. The concept was to go through the source code of the website I used (ceneo.pl), extract pieces of information containing a price/link to an offer/memory,where prices fell below 1500 pln. The data were put into the csv file afterwards. 

# Offer finder - analysis

I've also performed a simply analysis of the data I've collected using jupyter notebook, which provides a convenient environment for such purposes. To create some graphs I've implemented frameworks numpy and matplotlib to get familiar with features they offer.
